**VeneerVision AI** is a full-stack web application that uses AI to simulate dental veneers on smile images. Built with a React frontend and Express backend, powered by the Replicate API, it enables users to upload or capture a smile photo, select veneer shades, and view AI-generated previews. Designed for both patients and dentists, it features a quiz, lead capture, PDF reports, and a "Dentist Mode" for advanced simulations.

## ☁️ AWS Cloud Integration
Deployed VeneerVision AI as a scalable, production-grade cloud application using AWS services.

### 1. **Frontend Hosting**
- **Amazon S3 + CloudFront**: Hosted the React build as a static website with global CDN.
- **Steps:**
  - Built frontend: `cd frontend && npm run build`
  - Uploaded `frontend/build/` to an S3 bucket
  - Set up S3 static website hosting
  - Configured CloudFront for HTTPS and caching

### 2. **Backend/API Hosting**
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** (Node.js environment) or **AWS Lambda + API Gateway**
- **Elastic Beanstalk Steps:**
  - Zipped the `backend/` folder (with `package.json`)
  - Deployed via AWS Console
  - Set environment variables (API keys, etc)
- **Lambda Steps (Serverless):**
  - Refactored Express routes as Lambda handlers
  - Used AWS API Gateway to expose endpoints
  - Stored secrets in AWS Secrets Manager 

### 3. **File Storage**
- **Amazon S3**: Stored uploaded images and generated results
- Updated backend to upload/download files from S3

### 4. **CI/CD Pipeline**
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated build, test, and deploy to AWS (Elastic Beanstalk, S3, Lambda)
- Example: On push to `cloud` branch, trigger deployment jobs

### 5. **Monitoring & Security**
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Monitored logs and metrics
- **IAM Roles/Policies**: Secured access to S3, Lambda, etc
- **HTTPS**: Enforced via CloudFront and API Gateway
